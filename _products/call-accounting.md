Apogee is an affordable, PC-based, fully featured software system for tracking call records from all major legacy PBXs and IP-based systems. For over 35 years Apogee has been recognized as an industry-standard with the most feature-rich, cost-cutting, and productivity enhancing tools available.

Any organization can benefit from the innovative tools offered by the ApogeeNet Call Accounting System.  ApogeeNet modules help to reduce operational costs and to improve employee productivity within departments requiring efficient utilization of telecom resources. In addition to thorough tracking of telecom usage, ApogeeNet can track telecom and other equipment charges and implementation/installation costs via a browser-based work order tracking component.

While ApogeeNet contains all the traditional tools offered by a full-featured call accounting system, it also contains leading-edge business intelligence components that integrate with the traditional system and facilitate expansion into the brave new world of self-service, data-centric Business Intelligence.

## Reduce Telecom Costs

Cost analysis is a crucial phase in the process of telecom cost reduction. ApogeeNet has many inherent features that can help reconcile cost discrepancies – answer supervision recognition, multiple selectable billing methodologies, cost allocation reporting, gateway routing  – that can then be accommodated and combined with telco-grade pricing algorithms to analyze complex pricing scenarios.  Additionally equipment charges, credit card billing, governmental aggregation data, negotiated third-party rates,  message unit hierarchies, rate banding, and shared tenant methodologies can be incorporated to provide a complete breakdown of all corporate telecom expenses.

## Improve Sales

Sales managers need a high-level view of phone usage for their department, with the ability to drill down to specifics when necessary.  ApogeeNet sales reports pinpoint activity at a glance using pixel-perfect SAP Crystal Reports that allow for further drill-down to individual users or explicit calls.  New BI technologies allow for even further slicing-and-dicing by geographical location, time-slicing, animation, and any combination of user-defined metrics.

## Monitors and Alarms Detect Misuse/Abuse, Toll Fraud, System Thresholds

ApogeeNet has numerous conditions that can generate immediate alerts – calls to/from specific phone numbers, regions, accounts, or authorization codes; calls from specific DNIS Codes; above/below specific thresholds for time-of-day, duration, traffic volume, call error conditions; externally generated alarms can be retransmitted; and detection of suspicious date-stamp conditions.  Each alert can generate an email notification to multiple recipients and parameters can be adjusted on a site-by-site basis.

## Optimize Voice Network

Maintaining any voice network is an endless task.  Lack of supervision can cause unexpected reductions in available capacity and performance. ApogeeNet provides the reporting tools necessary for telecom managers to gain insight into their voice network, optimize performance, and improve global operational efficiency.  Engineering calculations based on actual usage help manage bandwidth requirements, circuit availability, busy hour blockage, and can be modeled to simulate network performance under alternative conditions.

## Call Progress Analysis

ApogeeNet has unique capabilities to analyze multi-leg call records and determine particular Call Sequence Patterns for inclusion in a variety of unique Apogee Report Groups.  Extensions are classified into over a dozen Extension Categories and call progress between these extension groups is analyzed by unique ApogeeNet pattern recognition algorithms.  Common patterns are used as the foundation of a variety of unique reports included within the suite of over 175 standard report templates and pattern metrics are available for visualization by utilizing the ApogeeNet Views tool within the Business Intelligence toolkit.  More details can be found by requesting our Incoming Call Management Solutions whitepaper. 

## Agent Performance

Large call centers or even smaller departments typically have incoming calls routed through a common phone number or extension to be presented to a pool of representatives trained to interact with the caller and subsequently transfer or complete the call. There are various schemes in which the incoming calls can then be distributed to the waiting agents or reps and a properly functioning call accounting system must be capable of being configured to match each distribution pattern.  ApogeeNet has various reports within the suite of over 175 standard reports that allow managers to access the performance of these representatives and evaluate the overall efficiency of the group – console, receptionist, hunt pilot, agent, and queue reports.

## Marketing and Advertising

Call records can contain hidden gems that can reveal the efficacy of marketing efforts and results from advertising campaigns.  In addition to the tools provided by geographical, busy hour, DNIS-based sorting and filtering, ApogeeNet has been designed to provide useful data mining tools that provide unique ways to visualize data and capture key performance metrics.
